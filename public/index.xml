      <description>This was a project that I made originally as a graded college assignment.
It was first made in Python and then rewritten in C.
Here is the code for the C version. The repo for the Python version is set to private because it contains copyrighted songs and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get sued.

      <description>Who am I?&amp;nbsp;¶ My name is Marcus Vinícius de Melo and I am from Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. I am currently a Computer Science student at CIn-UFPE and a former Physics student.
Why did I get into Physics and why did I leave it?&amp;nbsp;¶ I went to Middle and High School at an experimental school at which the faculty was composed of professors from Pernambuco&amp;rsquo;s Federal University (UFPE). In my High School years, I became close to the Physics faculty which usually organized the scientific olympiads that I used to participate.</description>
