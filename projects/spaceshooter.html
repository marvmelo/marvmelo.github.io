    <h1>Space Shooter</h1>
    <p>In the first semester of 2020, which actually occurred in 2021 due to the pandemic, I took a course in <i>Introduction to Programming</i>. As our final assignment, we had to form groups and code a game. My group, actually a pair, was <a href="https://github.com/matheus-baraujo">Matheus de Ara√∫jo</a>. We decided early on to make something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)">Asteroid</a>. The project was named Unnamed-Asteroidlike-Game, it later changed to Space Shooter. The project was entirely made in Python, for it was the language we had learned.</p>
    <p>After some thought, we decided that we wanted a game where you could pilot a ship in 2D and shoot at enemy ships while they shoot back at you.You start the game with 5 lifes, which is the maximum you can have. Every time you get shot, you lose a life; every time you land a hit, you gain 50 points. We also have some power-ups. There is a life power-up, that restore a life up to 5, and a shield power-up, that protects you against one single bullet. We thought about adding a speed power-up, but that would be more annoying than helpful.</p>
    <p>After we split the task, I got to do the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
