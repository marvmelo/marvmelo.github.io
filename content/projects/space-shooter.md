This was a project that I made originally as a graded college assignment.

It was first made in Python and then rewritten in C.

[Here](https://github.com/marvmelo/space-shooter-c-rewriting) is the code for the C version. The repo for the Python version is set to private because it contains copyrighted songs and I don't want to get sued.
