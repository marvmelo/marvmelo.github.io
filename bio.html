    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>My name is Marcus Vin√≠cius de Melo and I am from Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. I am currently a Computer Science student at <a href="https://portal.cin.ufpe.br/">CIn-UFPE</a> and a former Physics student.</p>
    <h1>Why did I get into Physics and why did I leave it?</h1>
    <p>I went to Middle and High School at an experimental school at which the faculty was composed of professors from Pernambuco's Federal University (UFPE). In my High School years, I became close to the Physics faculty which usually organized the scientific olympiads that I used to participate. Being a scientist was vague, yet lifelong, ambition of mine, my main options were Mathematics and Physics. The proximity I already had with Physics made it my choice when the time to choose a degree came.</p>
    <p>I did not take long to regret my decision. Although there is a lot wrong with Academia as a whole nowadays, a lot of the issues I experienced boils down to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_or_perish">publish or perish</a> and system of funding that breeds projects that are not expected go anywhere. This pervasive pressure to produce suboptimal work and prioritize the illusion of results over actual results put me off immensely. I am not saying that there is not great work being done in Physics right now, but the field surely looks more like a canteen than the well it used to be in the last few centuries.</p>
