    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>My name is Marcus Vin√≠cius de Melo and I am from Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. I am currently a Computer Science student at <a href="https://portal.cin.ufpe.br/">CIn-UFPE</a> and a former Physics student.</p>
    <h1>Why did I get into Physics and why did I leave it?</h1>
    <p>I went to Middle and High School at an experimental school at which the faculty was composed of professors from Pernambuco's Federal University (UFPE). In my High School years, I became close to the Physics faculty which usually organized the scientific olympiads that I used to participate. Being a scientist was vague, yet lifelong, ambition of mine. My main options were Mathematics and Physics. The proximity I already had with Physics made it my choice when the time to choose a degree came.</p>
    <p>I did not take long to regret my decision. Although there is a lot wrong with Academia as a whole nowadays, a lot of the issues I experienced boils down to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_or_perish">publish or perish</a>. This pervasive pressure to produce suboptimal work and prioritize the illusion of results over actual results put me off immensely.</p>
    <p>It is also worth noticing that even putting aside the problems of Academia, there is a lot wrong with Physics as a field. Theoretical Physics has got stuck in unobservable, and unverifiable ideas that can be best described as <i><a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/10/the-crisis-in-physics-is-not-only-about.html">mathematical fiction</a></i>. Applied Physics belongs in a weird limbo, where it is not pratical enough to be engineering nor intriguing enough to be a proper science. I am sure there is great work being done by physicists right now, but the field surely looks more like a canteen than the well it used to be in the last few centuries.</p>
    <h1>Why did I went to Computer Science?</h1>
    <p>That is not such a trivial answer as it could seem. When I decided to leave Physics, I wanted to go to Mathematics and even started taking some courses to do so. Right now is probably the most exciting time to be a mathematician. The field has grown from a handful of subjects, that a single person could master, to a cornucopia of interesting areas where fufilling discoveries await everywhere, in the last few centuries. Not to mention that Brazil has positioned itself as a top contributor to Mathematics in the last decades, due mostly to a few institutes like <a href="https://impa.br/en_US/">IMPA</a>, which means I could learn from and work with some of the best mathematicians in the world. However, with time, it became clear that my rejection to the current academic system was greater than my love for Mathematics. I did not leave it, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Lages_Lima">Elon Lages Lima</a> continues to be a bedside reading, but I am better as a hobbyist mathematician.</p>
    <p>When I decided that I did not want to become a professor anymore, I started to think of industry options with a Mathematics degree, the obvious one was Data Science. When I remarked to my partner that I thought that Software Engineering was more interesting work, she asked why would I study Computer Science instead. The idea seems heavily obvious now, but it had never seriously occured to me before. Given time, I realized that I was holding on to the objectives of a person that I no longer was, and this was what I really wanted.</p>
    <p>My relationship with coding was not new, in fact, I believe I have been coding since I was 16 (I no longer remember). I first learnt it to partake in the <a href="https://olimpiada.ic.unicamp.br/">Brazilian Informatics Olympiad</a>, which I really enjoyed. I usually was one of the three people of my state that would get to the final stage, only to be crushed by the ridiculous knowledge of algorithms expected from high schoolers. I think that my first language was JavaScript, which I learnt from Khan Academy and have now forgot. For a long time, programming seemed to be something I would do as a hobby, and later to help me do my main job. That has now completely changed.</p>
    <h1>What am I up to now?</h1>
    <p>I have recently studied Rust and I on the way to pratice it with some projects I have in mind now. Mainly a password manager that I want to make to get some ideas about cryptographic and hashing algorithms, and an emulator.</p>
    <p>I also intent to get back into competitive programming. I used to have a blast with it.</p>
    <p>Maybe I will go back to studying Machine Learning. It used to be my favorite field, but my interest has diminished. I think ML applied to Natural Language Processing can make me interested again.</p>
