    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>My name is Marcus Vin√≠cius de Melo and I am from Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. I am currently a Computer Science student at <a href="https://portal.cin.ufpe.br/">CIn-UFPE</a> and former Physics student.</p>
    <h1>Why did I get into Physics and why did I leave it?</h1>
    <p>I went to Middle and High School at an experimental school at which the faculty was composed of professors from Pernambuco's Federal University (UFPE). In my High School years, I became close to the Physics faculty which usually organized the scientific olympiads that I used to participate. Being a scientist was vague, yet lifelong, ambition of mine, my main options were Mathematics and Physics. The proximity I already had with Physics professors made it my choice.</p>
    <p>I did not take long to regret my decision.</p>
