      <description>I was about 16 when a friend showed me a video of an AI playing Super Mario. This had a great influence on my decision to learn how to code. To this day, reinforcement learning is my favorite area of machine learning and I find genetic computing very intriguing.
Recently I had the chance to try something like that by myself in a class I took about Machine Learning (although in much smaller scale).</description>

      <title>First attempt at Ray Tracing and Bezier Curves</title>

      <description>Last semester I took a course in Computer Graphics. It was mostly Linear Algebra, which made me feel right at home. My baggage as a former Physics student made it so that almost all the mathematics was quite easy. I could focus more on implement my group&amp;rsquo;s project, which I did almost all by myself.
There were two projects: a ray tracing engine and a bezier curves engine.
Ray Tracing&amp;nbsp;¶ The code for this project can be found here.</description>

      <description>This was a project that I made originally as a graded college assignment.
It was first made in Python and then rewritten in C.
Here is the code for the C version. The repo for the Python version is set to private because it contains copyrighted songs and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get sued.

      <description>Who am I?&amp;nbsp;¶ My name is Marcus Vinícius de Melo and I am from Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. I am currently a Computer Science student at CIn-UFPE and a former Physics student.
Why did I get into Physics and why did I leave it?&amp;nbsp;¶ I went to Middle and High School at an experimental school at which the faculty was composed of professors from Pernambuco&amp;rsquo;s Federal University (UFPE). In my High School years, I became close to the Physics faculty which usually organized the scientific olympiads that I used to participate.</description>
