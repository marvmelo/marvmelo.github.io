      <description>Last semester I took a course in Computer Graphics. It was mostly Linear Algebra, which made me feel right at home. My baggage as a former Physics student made it so that almost all the mathematics was quite easy. I could focus more on implement my group&amp;rsquo;s project, which I did almost all by myself.
There were two projects: a ray tracing and bezier curves.

      <description>This was a project that I made originally as a graded college assignment.
It was first made in Python and then rewritten in C.
Here is the code for the C version. The repo for the Python version is set to private because it contains copyrighted songs and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get sued.
