This had a great influence on my decision to learn how to code. To this day, reinforcement learning is my favorite area of machine learning and I find genetic computing very intriguing.</p>
<p>Recently I had the chance to try something like that by myself in a class I took about Machine Learning (although in much smaller scale). I used the <a href="https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment">Arcade Learning Enviroment</a> to simulate Space Invaders as my enviroment for a neural network agent to play.</p>
<p>Initially, my team and I wanted to implement the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298">Rainbow Deep Learning</a> algorithm to train our model. We soon found out that we did not have the hardware necessary to run it. So we split tasks.</p>
<p>They were responsible for tuning down the algorithm so we could run something like it. I became responsible for trying to use an evolutionary algorithm to solve our problem. That makes sense when you consider that evolutionary algorithms tend to converge very fast towards a local optimum (you get a solution, but it&rsquo;s not the best solution).</p>
<p>The video below shows how my evolutionary algorithm solved the problem. It found a local optimum where it just tries to shoot a bonus enemy.</p>
